            Changes To TIMSAC For R Package

            ***************************************


 timsac_1.3.3
================
* Corrected errors in inst/doc/index.html according to the error message of the W3C Markup Validator service.


 timsac_1.3.2
================
 * Fixed a bug in mulmar().
When max.order (upper limit of the order of AR model) is too large, output results are incorrect.
In such a case, max.order is changed to the appropriate value.

  (Reported by Jiri Baum)

 * Fixed bug in armafit(), baysea(), bispec(), decomp(), mlomar(), mulmar() and perars() for memory access issues under Valgrind.

  (Reported by Brian Ripley)

 * Fixed a bug in simcon.c.

  (Reported by Kurt Hornik and Brian Ripley)


 timsac_1.3.1
================
 * Corrected spelling errors of 'Airpollution'.

  (Reported by Vivek Rao)


 timsac_1.3.0
================
 * Set the correct dimension for array bounds (1) and (*) in Fortran source files.

 * Deleted the functions armaimp(), lsar2(), ngsmth(), tsmooth(), tvvar(), tvar() and tvspc().
  These functions have been added to another R package "TSSS".

 * Deleted a document "f77program.pdf" in doc directory.


 timsac_1.2.8
================
 * Added function lsar2().

 * Defined the functions print.blocar(), print.mlocar(), print.nonst() and print.tvvar() using S3method detective.

 * Renamed the argument 'ord' in perars() to 'subset'.

 * Deleted the argument 'ar.order' in tvspc().

 * Added a document "f77program.pdf" to doc directory.

 * Fixed bug in autoarmafit() and armafit().
  Added a array "CXY" equivalent to "CXX" to subroutine SC0GRH in autarmf.f.

 * Deleted the default value for delta in function tvvar() and tvar().

 * Fixed a bug in decomp().
  If argument "log" is TRUE and there is zero or negative number in input data y, output error message.

 * Fixed a bug in mulcor().
  In mulcor.c, size of allocVector are not enough.


 timsac_1.2.7
================
 * Fixed a bug in mulmar().
  Mulmar() did not work for certain types of data.   

  (Reported by William Pleasant)

 * Changed the maintainer address from "timsac at jasp.ism.ac.jp" to "ismrp at jasp.ism.ac.jp".


 timsac_1.2.6
================
 * Added C wrapper functions to call Fortran subroutines.

 * Deleted arguments 'tmp.file' in autoarmafit(), armafit(), exsar(), markov(), mulmar() and unimar().

 * Changed the type of argument 'smt' from "single" to "double" to use the type SEXP in ngsmth().

 * Fixed a bug in bsubst().
  In the case of mtype=3, the argument 'nreg'(number of regressors) of bsubst() is not invalid.
  It is computed automatically in R function.


 timsac_1.2.5
================
 * Fixed a bug in markov().
  Add arguments 'nh' to SUBROUTINE C0GR and SUBROUTINE NSUBX1 in markovf.f.

  Founded the following warnings in 00install.out (GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.7.0) :
  Warning: Rank mismatch in argument 'nh' at (1) (rank-1 and scalar)

 * Deleted arguments 'param' from FUNCTION UNIF and FUNCTION DBLEXP in ngsmthf.f.

  Founded the following warnings in 00install.out (GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.7.0) :
  Warning: Rank mismatch in argument 'param' at (1) (scalar and rank-1)
  Warning: Rank mismatch in argument 'param' at (1) (scalar and rank-1)


 timsac_1.2.4
================
 * Deleted the value 'spec' from tvar().

 * Added function tvspc().

 * Fixed a bug in tvar(). 
   In subroutine setcar, the size of the array "A" in the declaration is unsuitable.
   This often causes the abnormal termination of a routine process in which the argument "trend.order" is equal to 1.


 timsac_1.2.3
================
 * Deleted the arguments 'ncon', 'nman' and 'inw' then add the arguments 'control' and 'manip' in fpec() and mulnos().

 * Deleted the argument 'niv' in mulfrf().

 * Changed the allowed values of 'initd' from {0,1,2} to {1,2,3} in ngsmth().

 * Deleted C sources and call .Fortran in timsac.R.


 timsac_1.2.2
================
 * Fixed a bug in decomp(). In subroutine smoth3, the working array "D" is not long enough.
   This often causes the abnormal termination of a routine process in which the argument "seasonal.order" is equal to zero.

  (Reported by Seisho Sato)

 * Defined default value for 'outlier' as NULL in tvar().
 
 * Added an overview help page 'timsac-package'.


 timsac_1.2.1
================
 * In decomp() an argument 'imiss' is renamed 'miss' and given a detailed description. 


 timsac_1.2.0
================
 * Added function baysea().

 * Added 'lag' to arguments of function canarm() in timsac.R.


 timsac_1.1.4
================
 * Added a set of macros (F77_NAME(name), F77_CALL(name)) in all C source files (arma.c, auspec.c, ..., xsarma.c) 

 * Fixed a bug in fpec().
  aperm(arcoef, c(2,3,1)) give an error if z$ordermin = 1. (Reported by Seisho Sato)


 timsac_1.1.3
================
 * Fixed a bug in blomar(). Added 'F1' and 'F2' to arguments of subroutine MNONSB in blomarf.f.

 * Fixed a bug in mlomar(). Added 'X' and 'U' to arguments of subroutine MNONST in mlomarf.f.


 timsac_1.1.2
================
 * Added function tsmooth().


 timsac_1.1.1
================
 * Changed the type of argument 'smt' from "double" to "single" in ngsmth().

 * Changed the function name "arma()" to "armaimp()".


 timsac_1.1.0
================
 * Added functions arma(), tvvar(), tvar() and ngsmth().


 timsac_1.0.1
================
 * Fixed a bug in decomp() where both seasonal component and trading day effect
    are no consideration. The following example demonstrates the problem:

        data(Blsallfood)
        decomp(Blsallfood, seasonal.order=0)   # trade=FALSE (default)
